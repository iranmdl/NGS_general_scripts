Homemade scripts for handling NGS data

## Getting Started

Miscellanea bioinformatics scripts
This repo contains general scripts I've used along my career for handling NGS data (fastq, fasta, bam/sam, VCG, GFF3/GTF files...)
Many of these scripts do something very specific and they don't deserve their own repository. Some of the scripts are well supported
and tested while others are drafts that maybe can only work in ideal conditions (only my conditions :P)
